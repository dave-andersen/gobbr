gobbr
=====

Go RPC interface for Boolberry wallet and daemon.

For now, see the bbstat/bbstat.go program as an example of how to
use the interface.  Real docs will come soon.

The example program bbsend/bbsend.go can be used to transfer
BBR to another account from the command line, and shows how to
use the Transfer function.
